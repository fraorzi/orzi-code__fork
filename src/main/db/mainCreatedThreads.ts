/**
 * Thread rows main inserted or recovered — remote `start` commands, schedules,
 * orchestrator launches, duplicate repair — that the renderer has not mirrored yet.
 *
 * The renderer persists its whole store through `dbSyncAll`, which deletes every
 * thread row missing from that snapshot. A main-created row is missing from it
 * until the forwarded `start` command reaches the renderer, and the delete
 * cascades into `thread_runtime_items`: the launch turn's `user_message` (already
 * persisted from the supervisor's emit) disappears, and later events are dropped
 * until the renderer re-creates the row. Ids tracked here are exempt from that
 * delete; the first renderer snapshot carrying an id hands ownership back to the
 * renderer, so its own deletions keep working.
